# Matrix Multiplier in C++

## üìñ Overview
This project implements a **Matrix Multiplication program in C++**, designed to explore both the fundamentals of matrix operations and performance considerations.  

It supports:
- **Sequential multiplication** (baseline implementation)
- (Optionally) **Parallel multiplication** using multiple threads (if you extend it)
- Clean and modular C++ class design

This project helped me deepen my understanding of:
- Efficient use of **C++ classes** and memory management
- Handling **large datasets** and computational complexity
- Foundations for **high-performance computing**

---

## ‚ö° Features
- `Matrix` class with:
  - Constructor for creating matrices of arbitrary dimensions
  - Input/output utilities for printing and filling matrices
  - Operator overloading for clean syntax (`A * B`)
- Support for **square and rectangular matrices**
- Error handling for invalid dimensions
- (Optional future work) Multithreading with `std::thread`

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies
- **Language:** C++17 (or newer)
- **Build system:** g++ / clang++
- **Libraries:** Standard Template Library (STL)
